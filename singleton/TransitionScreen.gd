extends CanvasLayer
## Transition Screen singleton
##
## Usage:
## - create scene TransitionScreen.tscn and register it as autoload singleton scene
##   (the easiest is to copy TransitionScreenTemplate.tscn, and also re-save the associated
##   animation library transition_screen_template_animation_library.tres as
##   some custom res in the same game project folder to avoid resource sharing)
##
## If you use a custom TransitionScreen, add an AnimationPlayer to it with RESET,
## fade_in and fade_out animations.
## We recommend that RESET state corresponds to fade_in end and fade_out start,
## i.e. the state where the screen fade is not visible at all.

### This should not be called during another fade in/out

	# At this point, we know that the 'fade_in' animation is being played,
	# and the user should not try to play another animation to interrupt this one,
	# so we can just await animation_finished signal instead of doing a full check
	# with an animation_finished callback + check animation name => emit custom finish signal.
	# This allows the user to await this method directly instead of awaiting a custom signal.
	await animation_player.animation_finished

### Fade out screen and await for animation end
### This should not be called during another fade in/out
func fade_out_async(animation_speed: float = 1.0):
	visible = true

	_play_fade_out(animation_speed)

	# If using the TransitionScreen template or configuring the custom TransitionScreen
	# so that RESET state corresponds to fade_in end and fade_out start,
	# i.e. the state where the screen fade is not visible at all, as recommended,
	# fade out should start perfectly the first time.
	# Otherwise, it may glitch one frame showing the fully hidden state (typically a black screen)
	# due to animation rendering lag, and in this case we need the `advance(0)` hack for safety.
	animation_player.advance(0)

	# Same remark as fade_in_async
	await animation_player.animation_finished
